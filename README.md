# jv-salary-info

Implement method `getSalaryInfo(String[] names, String[] data, String dateFrom, String dateTo)`. 
It should calculate the salary for employees. As input, you receive two arrays and two dates in String format. 
 - Date represents limits that you should meet while calculating salary for employees (inclusively).
 - The first array (`names`) contains the names of employees you should calculate salary for.
 - The second array (`data`) contains info about their working hour during the particular day and income per hour. 

The method should return info in the following format:
```
   Report for period #date_1# - #date_2#
   #Name of employee# - #money earned#
```
